Concerns:
- Should a book's iamges be stored in memory or opened from the file each time the page is turned?
	- With lots of big images (a likely base), storing them in memory would take a ton of RAM
	  but make them load much faster.
	- Compromise by storing a few pages at a time?
- Is the MD5 checked in the BookBuilder othe ARMB?
- Source...FileName variables in BB_Book are junk if you're opening the book on a different computer
	so they shouldn't be relied on for anything unless the book was just created


To do:
- Add drag and drop for videos
- Be able to open books in builder
	- Serialize BB_Book in ARMB file
	- Should be able to open books from setup form or main form
- Have Save and Save As buttons in main form
- Force all images in the book to be the same size
	- How? Forcing them to be the first image's size would be weird.
- Allow user to remove audio file or video file from a page
- Allow user to add or remove pages
- Give a warning if two pages that would show at the same time both have audio.
- Maybe prevent user from making windows too small to hold everything?
