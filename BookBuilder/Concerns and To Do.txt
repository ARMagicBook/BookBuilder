To do:
Necessary:
- Fix bug where saving a book before viewing all pages gives "pages aren't same size" error.

Very helpful:
- Give a "Would you like to save before exiting? [Save, Don't Save, or Cancel] dialog box when the user is about to exit."
- Allow user to remove video file from a page
- Allow user to add or remove pages
Not important:
- fix nonsense video x/y, w/h values that happen when you add a page image w/o a video
