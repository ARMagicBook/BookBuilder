To do:
Necessary:
- Fix bug where video placeholder image doesn't show when opening a book
- Fix bug when resizing page w/ video on it

Very helpful:
- Give a "Would you like to save before exiting? [Save, Don't Save, or Cancel] dialog box when the user is about to exit."
- Allow user to remove video file from a page
- Allow user to add or remove pages
Not important:
- Maybe prevent user from making windows too small to hold everything?
- fix nonsense video x/y, w/h values that happen when you add a page image w/o a video
