To do:
- Add drag and drop for videos
- Give a "Would you like to save before exiting? [Save, Don't Save, or Cancel] dialog box when the user is about to exit."
- Have Save button in main form
- Don't allow the user to add an image that's not the same size as the first image
- Allow user to remove audio file or video file from a page
- Allow user to add or remove pages
- Give a warning if two pages that would show at the same time both have audio.
- Maybe prevent user from making windows too small to hold everything?
